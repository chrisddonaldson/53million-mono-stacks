### **2.1.3 Guided Coaching & Timers**

_As Chris, I want guided coaching with timers and instructions, and big clear animated visuals and sounds so that I can follow each workout efficiently and correctly.
_
It should tell me what exercise to do
For how long
How much to lift
How many times
Show me progressions
Call out throughout workout 
Encoraging ai messages, you're doing so good. 
Up down voice over
Sync with my youtube music playlists
Each micro workout has a config to generate the coach
The coach is a webgpu animation, a bit like a wizard flow that walks the user through the workout. 
It has different modes but mostly functions like a tabtta cicires wehere its exercise for x reps and each rep is timed out by the ai. 

Should use game UI layers:
1. Diegetic UI
2. Non-diegetic (HUD) UI
3. Meta
4. system UI
