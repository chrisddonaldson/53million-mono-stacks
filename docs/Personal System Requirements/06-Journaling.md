# **6. Journaling**

## **6.1 Infinity Journal (UPDATED)**

_As Chris, I want an Infinity Journal that is actually a WebGL-rendered calendar with smooth scrolling and smart API calls, so that I can navigate my history, metrics, and logs in multiple visualisations._

## **6.2 Bullet Journal (UPDATED)**

_As Chris, I want a touch-focused bullet journal that organises my day and automatically pulls tasks from other services, so that I receive a recommended day setup._
